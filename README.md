# Odin Recipes

This project is a basic recipes website created as an assignment for the Foundations course from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).

At first, this project goal is to put basic HTML concepts to use, such as
- HTML boilerplate
- Headers
- Links
- Images
- Unordered and ordered lists
- File structure

It is also used to practice using Git terminal commands.
